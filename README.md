# Computing Helpbot
An attempt to let my friends have some way to finally practice their Computing skills!
Powered by Claude-3.5-Sonnet until I run out of Credits lol.

This may be ported to Gemini (since it is free) in the future, which is why claude has a whole layer for interaction.


For making this app work, you'll need to create a file called `confidential.py` which contains this:
```python
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-from-anthropic"
```
